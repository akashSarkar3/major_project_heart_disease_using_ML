**Description :**
The project "Design and Implementation of Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning Algorithms" aims to save lives by improving the accuracy and efficiency of heart disease diagnosis. By leveraging rapidly growing medical data from hospital information systems, the project applies machine learning techniques to analyze patient data and predict heart disease. Traditional paper-based medical records and physician-dependent diagnoses are prone to errors and are time-consuming and costly. In contrast, machine learning allows for structured data analysis, reducing costs and diagnosis times. The project employs supervised learning algorithms such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks, with the Random Forest algorithm achieving the highest accuracy in predictions. This approach enhances diagnostic precision, making healthcare more effective and accessible.
